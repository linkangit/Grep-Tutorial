# Grep Tutorial for Bioinformaticians

A comprehensive 10-level tutorial designed to teach bioinformaticians the power of `grep` for searching and analyzing biological data files.

## Overview

This tutorial progresses from basic text searching to advanced pattern matching techniques commonly used in bioinformatics workflows. Each level includes practical examples using real biological file formats like FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, VCF, and SAM/BAM files.

## Prerequisites

- Basic command line familiarity
- Access to a Unix-like system (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)
- Basic understanding of bioinformatics file formats

## Tutorial Structure

### **Level 1: Basic Grep Fundamentals**
- Simple text searches
- Case sensitivity options
- Basic wildcards

### **Level 2: Regular Expressions Basics**
- Character classes and ranges
- Anchors (^ and $)
- Quantifiers (*, +, ?)

### **Level 3: FASTA File Manipulation**
- Extracting sequences by header patterns
- Counting sequences
- Finding sequences by length patterns

### **Level 4: FASTQ Quality Analysis**
- Quality score filtering
- Read ID extraction
- Adapter sequence detection

### **Level 5: Advanced Regular Expressions**
- Grouping and backreferences
- Alternation and complex patterns
- Extended regex (-E flag)

### **Level 6: GFF/GTF File Processing**
- Feature type filtering
- Coordinate range searches
- Attribute extraction

### **Level 7: VCF File Analysis**
- Variant filtering by quality
- Genotype pattern matching
- Multi-sample analysis

### **Level 8: Performance Optimization**
- Using `-F` for fixed strings
- Optimizing complex patterns
- Memory-efficient searches on large files

### **Level 9: Advanced Grep Options**
- Context lines (-A, -B, -C)
- Inverse matching (-v)
- Multiple file processing
- Binary file handling

### **Level 10: Integration with Bioinformatics Pipelines**
- Combining grep with other tools (awk, sed, cut)
- Pipeline optimization
- Real-world bioinformatics use cases

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to `level-01/` to begin
3. Each level contains:
   - `README.md` with instructions and examples
